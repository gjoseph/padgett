An IRC robot written in Groovy, which can reload "plugins" on the fly, simply because it monitors the "plugins" directory.

TODO:
* plugin order (alphabetical?)
* load subfolders of plugins
* load with pattern, so classes and other utils can stay there
* daemonize
* build, single jar
* instructions, setup, install

* plugin name ?
* plugin dependencies ? (could be useful, or even needed, for proper reload/restart)

* save plugin states ?

PLUGINS TO WRITE:
* config, connect, join channels
* take-over
* log
* meetbot (with voice)
* jira info
* "shut up" (bot will be silent until his name is said)
* wait for user (bot will notice you when user join and/or send a message to the user)
