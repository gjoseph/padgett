Padgett is an IRC robot written in Groovy, exposing a simple plugin system.
Every bit of functionality in Padgett is written as a plugin, and plugins can be deployed or reloaded without restarting the bot.

Padgett - Meaning of the name
(Middle English) little page; (Middle English) server, helper
[ 2 syll. pad-get(t), pa-dge-tt ] Padgett is a form of the English Paget. Padgett is a form of the English Paige,
which is itself from the ordinary English word page ('servant, helper'). This word is in turn derived via Old French and Italian from the Greek 'paidion'.
In medieval times, pages were male servants to lords, but the modern use of the name is almost exclusively for girls, for reasons that are unclear.

Also, whatever. "Padgett" sounds like "Gadget", so why not.

TODO:
* plugin order (alphabetical?)
* load subfolders of plugins
* load with pattern, so classes and other utils can stay there
* daemonize
* build, single jar
* instructions, setup, install

* plugin name ?
* plugin dependencies ? (could be useful, or even needed, for proper reload/restart)

* save plugin states ?

PLUGINS TO WRITE:
* config, connect, join channels
* take-over
* log
* meetbot (with voice)
* jira info
* "shut up" (bot will be silent until his name is said)
* wait for user (bot will notice you when user join and/or send a message to the user)
